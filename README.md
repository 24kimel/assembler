# assembler v1.5.4
C project for the open university. 

this project you see here is the final version of a project I sent to the open university

this project got a perfect score

to know about the algorithm behind it, read assember_instructions.pdf

to know the technique behind my specific assembler, read the documentation found in the source file

thanks to my dad (https://github.com/amitkm73) for helping me to debug the project, creating the testing program for output and doing code reviews
